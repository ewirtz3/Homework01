Sorted the CSS file so that each section is divvied up more clearly and labeled
Changed div tags in the HTML to be more specific, including header, nav, figure, section, aside, footer; adjusted any corresponding CSS selectors
Added id of search-engine-optimization to the SEO section so that the link click would jump properly to that spot on the page
Added a title to the head section
Changed classes to match so that I could consolidate the CSS: all content divs now have a class of services-section, and all benefits divs have a class of benefit-section
