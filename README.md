# HTML Refactor

## Description

For this project, I refactored given HTML and CSS files to make the webpage more legible and aesthetically pleasing. My refactor notes are below:

- Sorted the CSS file so that each section is divvied up more clearly and labeled
- Changed div tags in the HTML to be more specific, including header, nav, figure, section, aside, footer; adjusted any corresponding CSS selectors
- Added id of search-engine-optimization to the SEO section so that the link click would jump properly to that spot on the page
- Added a title to the head section
- Changed classes to match so that I could consolidate the CSS: all content divs now have a class of services-section, and all benefits divs have a class of benefit-section
